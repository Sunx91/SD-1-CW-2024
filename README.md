# Traffic Data Analysis Tool

This project processes traffic survey CSV files and generates summary statistics for each selected date. It also displays a histogram comparing vehicle flow across two junctions using a simple graphical interface.

## Features
- Validates user date input and loads matching CSV files
- Calculates traffic metrics such as vehicle counts, speed violations, and peak hours
- Saves results to a text file for later review
- Visualizes hourly traffic data using a histogram

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Standard Python libraries only (csv, tkinter, etc.)

## How to Run
1. Place the traffic CSV files in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the main Python file:
3. Follow the prompts to enter a date and view results.

## Output
- Console summary of traffic statistics
- `results.txt` file containing saved outputs
- Histogram window showing hourly traffic distribution

## Notes
This project was developed as part of a university coursework assignment.
